# Formalization differences

Where the statements of `epidemics/` deviate from their sources, and why.

## The Kermack–McKendrick SIR model (`KermackMcKendrick*`, EPI-7)

Sources: W. O. Kermack, A. G. McKendrick, *A contribution to the mathematical theory of
epidemics*, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 115 (1927) 700–721; H. W. Hethcote, *The mathematics of
infectious diseases*, SIAM Review 42 (2000) 599–653, §2.3, system (2.2) and Theorem 2.1.

1. **Special case of Kermack–McKendrick 1927.** Their model has infectivity and removal rates
   depending on the age of infection; as in Hethcote §2.3, we formalize the constant-rate
   special case (the SIR ODE). Docstrings cite Hethcote 2000 (system (2.2), Theorem 2.1) for
   numbering, since the 1927 paper has no numbered theorems.
2. **Solution as hypothesis, on `[0, ∞)`.** Hethcote states existence, uniqueness and positive
   invariance of the triangle `T`; we do not construct solutions. The ODE is Mathlib's
   `IsIntegralCurveOn` of `fun _ ↦ sirField β γ` on `Set.Ici 0`, i.e. derivatives within
   `[0, ∞)` (one-sided at `0`); values for `t < 0` are irrelevant. Positivity of `s` and `i` is
   proved, not assumed.
3. **`ℝ³` as `ℝ × ℝ × ℝ`, components as three functions.** The curve is
   `fun t ↦ (s t, i t, r t)`; the theorems speak about `s`, `i`, `r` directly. We keep `r` in
   the state with `r' = γ i` (Hethcote eliminates it by `r = 1 - s - i`; here conservation is a
   theorem, `IsSolution.sum_eq_one`).
4. **Initial data.** Hethcote allows `s₀, i₀ ≥ 0` and `r(0) = 1 - s₀ - i₀ ≥ 0`; we fix
   `r(0) = 0` and `s(0), i(0) > 0`. Hence `i₀ + s₀ = 1`, and his equation
   `i₀ + s₀ - s∞ + ln(s∞/s₀)/σ = 0` becomes `s∞ = s₀ exp(-R₀(1 - s∞))`. The peak value is
   stated verbatim as `i₀ + s₀ - 1/R₀ - log(R₀ s₀)/R₀`.
5. **"Initially increases"** is formalized as `∃ ε > 0, StrictMonoOn i (Set.Icc 0 ε)` (a
   statement about `i`, not merely the sign of `i'(0)`, which would be a tautology).
6. **Threshold, subcritical case.** Hethcote's "if `σ s₀ ≤ 1`, `i(t)` decreases to zero" is
   split into `strictAntiOn_i` (strictly decreasing on `[0, ∞)`) and `tendsto_i` (which holds
   for every solution).
7. **Limits.** "`s∞` exists" is `∃ sInfty, Tendsto s atTop (𝓝 sInfty)`; the properties of `s∞`
   are stated for any limit (hypothesis `Tendsto s atTop (𝓝 sInfty)`), avoiding a `limUnder`
   definition. `i∞ = 0` is `Tendsto i atTop (𝓝 0)`; `r∞ = 1 - s∞` is `tendsto_r`.
8. **Uniqueness of the final size.** Hethcote's "unique root in `(0, 1/σ)`" is stated on the
   slightly larger `(0, 1/R₀]` (`R₀ x ≤ 1`), together with `0 < s∞` and `R₀ s∞ < 1`; we also add
   uniqueness on `(0, 1]` (`final_size_unique_of_le_one`), the physically meaningful range.
9. **Additions**, all from Hethcote's Theorem 2.1: `strictAntiOn_s`, `strictMonoOn_r`,
   `strictAntiOn_i`, `tendsto_r`, `limit_pos`, `R₀_mul_limit_lt_one`, the two uniqueness
   statements and `exists_peak`.
10. **Proof route.** Positivity of `i` uses the barrier `i(t) ≥ i(0) e^{-γ t}/2` (via
    `image_le_of_deriv_right_lt_deriv_boundary'`) instead of integrating `β s - γ` or Gronwall.
    The model-independent calculus lemmas (constancy and strict monotonicity from the sign of a
    derivative within `[0, ∞)`, limits of monotone functions) are in
    `KermackMcKendrickCalculus.lean`.
