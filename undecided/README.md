# The undecided-state dynamics

Synchronous undecided-state dynamics with two opinions on the complete graph (each node samples one node uniformly, with replacement). Main results in [`Undecided/Basic.lean`](Undecided/Basic.lean), namespace `Undecided`; see the
[blueprint](blueprint/src/content.tex) for the statements and the map to Lean declarations.

**Provenance.** The statements were written and pinned by hand; the proofs were produced by a Grok
agent under a fixed-statement protocol and verified mechanically (statements unchanged, no
placeholders, warning-free build, axiom audit).

Build and audit:

```bash
lake exe cache get
lake build
python3 ../scripts/check_axioms.py
```

This package uses the sibling `dynamics/` package's Lean 4.32.0 toolchain and exact Mathlib pin.
